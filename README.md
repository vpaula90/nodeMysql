Built an app where it will list all the items that are available in a table built in MySQL bench.

Then ask for the id for the item you want to purchase and then ask how many you want to purchase.

It will then display the total cost of what you are purchasing and then ask if you would like to purchase anything else.

If you request a quantity more than what is available it will let you know that there are not enough of the item you are requesting. 

If you do not wish to purchase another item it will stop the server
